# Snowmaker

https://snowmaker.io

A peer-to-peer crowdfunding platform for the Avalanche community of BUIDLers.

## Motivation

Blockchain developers have many resources available to them for building. But when it comes to financing, there are very few on-chain solutions to choose from.

Snowmaker aims to be the "rainmaker" for developers building on the Avalanche blockchain.

## Featured Benefits

1. Discoverability
2. Donor Protections
3. Accountability

### Discoverability

Snowmaker makes it super easy to find new and noteworthy projects to support.

> Our team is currently running a campaign seeking $10,000 to showcase the teams from the recent Moralis + Avalanche hackathon.

### Donor Protections

Donors will ALWAYS maintain complete control over the campaigns they support. At any time, before the campaign ends, they can add/modify/remove their pledge.

### Accountability

_WIP_

Our team aims to develop a Report Card system to encourage accountability and transparency AFTER a campaign has been successfully funded.

> Our team is currently running a campaign seeking $10,000 to help us develop the Report Card system and introduce the highest level of accountability and transparency of ANY crowdfunding platform that exists today.
